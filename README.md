# Destination Dashboard

Created a travel lifestyle application that allows the user to input destination upon arrival and be presented with all the basic information/travel tips, popular attractions and restaurants in the area so that they can enjoy my stay as soon as they land. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.



## User Story

```

I WANT to add search palces to eat and visit 
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively and be
ready prior arrival

```


## Acceptance Criteria

```
