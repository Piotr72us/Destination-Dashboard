# Hungry

## In this project, we will be implementing intuitive ways to find foods based on location. The user is allowed to find foods by dietary restrictions and current "cravings"

## Our app will be designed as a system that will allow user's to input what kind of food(s) they are searching for, it will then give the user the option to find a restaurant which serves the food they are looking for, or prompt the user which ingredients will be needed to cook the recipe on their own.

## The app will also be designed to work on the go throughout multiple locations. If the user was travelling through a certain city, the app will guide the user to the nearest restaurants which have the cuisine that best suits their taste at that time.

## The location services are currently in beta testing process and will be released at a later time.
